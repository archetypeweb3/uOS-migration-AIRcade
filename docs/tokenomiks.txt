// Total Supply: 1,000,000 UOS

The UOS token serves as the core utility and governance token for the Universal Operating System (uOS) protocol. uOS is a meta-framework that provides a unified interface for interacting with multiple AI platforms, acting as an orchestration layer that enables seamless communication and interoperability between technologies while preserving their native functionality.

The token facilitates multiple revenue streams including:
- App Store Revenue: Fees from app sales and subscriptions within the uOS ecosystem
- Premium OS Features: Subscription fees for enhanced storage and advanced features
- Agent Task Fees: Fees from AI agent operations and collaborations
- Tokenized IP Revenue: Royalties from AI-generated content and licensing
- Infrastructure Fees: Hosting and OS usage fees for verified agents

The token also functions as a governance mechanism, granting holders voting rights over critical protocol decisions including future upgrades and treasury management. Through the vote-escrow system (veUOS), token holders can lock their tokens to receive enhanced governance power and protocol revenue sharing. Revenue is distributed weekly based on:
- Lock duration (longer locks = higher share)
- Lock amount (more tokens = higher share)
- Protocol utilization (fees from operations)

New UOS tokens are minted as rewards for participants who contribute to the ecosystem through agent operations, content creation, and infrastructure support. This emission mechanism incentivizes network participants to contribute their resources while maintaining a sustainable token distribution model.

// Initial Claims & Migration (10%):

The SOL/UOS to WETH migration enables protocol transition from Solana to Base. The process includes snapshotting SOL/UOS balances, generating Merkle proofs for claims, and implementing a secure claim system via uos.earth. All eligible holders receive UOS tokens at a 0.1:1 ratio.

- SOL/UOS Migration: 10% (100,000 UOS)
  - Distribution Rate: 0.1 UOS for every 1 SOL held
  - Examples:
    * 100 SOL = 10 UOS
    * 1,000 SOL = 100 UOS
    * 10 SOL = 1 UOS
  - Minimum Claim: 1 UOS (even if SOL amount would give less)
  - Claims available via uos.supply/claim
  - Immediate availability upon launch
  - Total Distribution: Exactly 100,000 UOS

  Technical Implementation:
  ```typescript
  // Constants
  const DECIMALS = 18;                    // Standard ERC20 decimals
  const ONE_TOKEN = BigInt(10) ** BigInt(DECIMALS);  // 1e18
  const CLAIM_POOL_AMOUNT = BigInt(100000) * ONE_TOKEN;  // 100,000 UOS

  // Example calculation
  function calculateClaim(solBalance: bigint): bigint {
    // Convert SOL balance to UOS (0.1:1 ratio)
    const rawClaim = (solBalance * BigInt(100000)) / BigInt(1000000);  // 0.1 ratio with 6 decimal precision
    
    // Ensure minimum claim of 1 UOS
    if (rawClaim === BigInt(0) && solBalance > BigInt(0)) {
      return ONE_TOKEN;
    }
    
    return rawClaim * ONE_TOKEN;  // Convert to proper decimals
  }

  // Example usage:
  // 100 SOL = 10 UOS
  const hundredSol = BigInt(100) * ONE_TOKEN;
  const tenUos = calculateClaim(hundredSol);
  // tenUos = 10 * 1e18 UOS tokens

  // 1,000 SOL = 100 UOS
  const thousandSol = BigInt(1000) * ONE_TOKEN;
  const hundredUos = calculateClaim(thousandSol);
  // hundredUos = 100 * 1e18 UOS tokens
  ```

// Protocol Emissions (60%):
- veUOS Emissions: 60% (600,000 UOS)
  - Vote-escrow mechanism for governance
  - Lock periods: 1 week to 2 years
  - Weekly reward distributions
  - Revenue sharing from protocol fees
  - Multiple lock positions via veNFTs

The veUOS system enables token holders to lock their UOS tokens to receive enhanced governance power and protocol revenue. Locking periods range from 1 week to 2 years, with longer locks providing higher voting power and revenue share. Each lock position is represented as a unique veNFT, allowing holders to manage multiple positions. Weekly rewards are distributed based on lock duration, amount, and protocol utilization.

// Development & Operations:

A 10% allocation of all newly minted $uOS is directed towards the UOS treasury, governed by the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This allocation is designed to support the ongoing development of $uOS and its related infrastructure, with a 4-year linear vesting period.

Linear vesting via Sablier ensures transparent and predictable token distribution, preventing large token unlocks that could impact market stability. This approach aligns long-term incentives between the team, treasury, and protocol success.

- Treasury: 10% (100,000 UOS)
  - DAO governed
  - 4-year linear vesting via Sablier

- Team: 10% (100,000 UOS)
 - 4-year linear vesting via Sablier


// Liquidity:
- Initial DEX Liquidity: 1% (10,000 UOS)
  - Uniswap v2 pair bootstrapping
  
- LP Staking Rewards: 9% (90,000 UOS)
  - Incentivize liquidity providers
  - Distributed through Pool2
